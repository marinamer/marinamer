## Hi there 👋 

My name is Marina and I'm from Spain. I studied Philosophy, specialised in Political Philosophy and worked on my PhD for four years until I decided that I wanted to change career paths and apply some of my skills on another field. That's when I found Data Analytics! 

- 🔭 I’m currently on the last few weeks of my bootcamp at Ironhack and I'm very excited to start my career as a Data Analyst!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning
