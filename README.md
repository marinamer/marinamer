## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Marina and I'm from Spain. I studied Philosophy, specialised in Political Philosophy and worked on my PhD for four years until I decided that I wanted to change career paths and apply some of my skills on another field. That's when I found Data Analytics! 

- ðŸ”­ I just finished the Data Analytics bootcamp at Ironhack and I'm very excited to start my career as a Data Analyst!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Junior ML Engineer at Omdena as part of a 50 people team and so far it's been an amazing experience!
